<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Willie Logan and I am a student at Davis AeroSpace, My hobbies are playing video games, researching cars and planes, and riding my bike. Why do i like doing these is that their fun to do, with video games I can talk to new people, with researching cars and planes I can learn new ways to operate on cars/planes and possibly build a car/planes, and biking around is that I can explore new places that I have never known. My goals are to become a techinal engineer, mechanical engineer, or a pro race car race driver.
