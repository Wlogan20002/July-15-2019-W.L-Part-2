<p>The Huayra Gyrfalcon is as incredible as incredible gets. This is a one-off creation done right. Unlike some of Pagani’s past SEs and one-offs where names were seemingly picked out of thin air, the Huayra Roadster Gyrfalcon lives up to its inspiration.

The supercar’s exterior, for example, is dressed up in a white body finish similar to the White Gyrfalcon’s feathers. The exposed carbon fiber is reminiscent of the gyrfalcon’s spotted black wings, while the bright yellow accents spread throughout the car are meant to evoke the yellow colors on the bird’s beak, feet, and circles around its eyes. Pagani didn’t any add any aerodynamic modifications, and nor should it. The Pagani Huayra Roadster Gyrfalcon is so beautiful to look at that it hurts our feelings doing so.</p>
